<!-- ## About me -->
<br>Hi! I am a final-year(senior) undergrad majoring in Computer Science and Technology at Zhejiang Gongshang University. Supervised by [Prof. Hua Zhang](https://scie.zjgsu.edu.cn/zh-hans/node/381), I am working on Natural Language Processing Research Group.

I am also open to other topics. Feel free to reach out if you would like to chat!

(This webpage was last updated on **Mar 2024**)

## Research Interests
* **Pre-trained Language Model**, investigating how to leverage the rich prior knowledge in pre-trained language models to accomplish general tasks, with a particular focus on machine reading comprehension and prompt-based learning frameworks.
* **Contrastive Learning**, focusing on leveraging contrastive learning to enhance the quality of embeddings and to enable more nuanced and context-aware language model performances.
* **Dual Learning**, utilizing the primal-dual structure between machine learning tasks to obtain effective feedback/regularization, guiding and reinforcing the learning process, thereby reducing the requirements for large-scale learning.
